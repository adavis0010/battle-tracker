# Battle Tracker
Battle tracker is an application that allows that allows for the GM in table-top RPGs to better manage information during an in-game battle. It was developed specifically for Dungeons and Dragons, but may be useful for other games, too. It allows the DM to keep track of Hit Points for all creatures in a battle, conditions, and number of rounds.

## Usage
### Adding Creatures
To add a creature to the board, click the add button under the approriate column. You will be given the option to add a creature name and number HP from the official D&D Monster Manual, or add your own custom values.

### Reset Button
Clicking the reset button will delete all creatures from the board.

##Technologies
Battle tracker is built using React and react-bootstrap.

## Roadmap
Battle Tracker is currently in active developement. Future features include a log in feature, a feature that helps you keep track of status effects, dynamically adjustable hit points, the ability to change the order of creatures in the list to track initiative order, a save and load encounter functionality, and a dropdown that displays the full stats of creatures added from the Monster Manual.
