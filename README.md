#Battle Tracker
Battle tracker is an application that allows that allows the GM for table-top RPGs to better manage information during an in-game battle. It was developed specifically for Dungeons and Dragons, but may be useful for other games, too. It allows the DM to keep track of Hit Points for all creatures in a battle, status effects, and number of rounds.

##Usage
###Adding Creatures
To add a creature to the board, click the add button under the approriate column. You will be given the option to add a creature name and number HP from the official D&D Monster Manual, or add your own custom values. When adding a custom creature, you can choose to save its values to reuse for another battle.

###Adding Status Effects
Selecting the options button on any added creature will allow you to either delete a creature from the board or add a status effect to that creature. You can add status effect from a list. Adding an effect will cause the application to display an alert, reminding the user to resolve the status effect in-game. Unchecking an effect will remove it from the alerts.

###Reset Button
Clicking the reset button will delete all creatures from the board.

##Roadmap
Battle Tracker is currently in active developement. Future features include the ability to change the order of creatures in the list to track initiative order, a save and load encounter functionality, and a dropdown that displays the full stats of creatures added from the Monster Manual.
